Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the DLSR don't manage to take the photo Pibooth will show the "Oops something went wrong" screen. Most of the issues that our users encountered are either linked to:

- Not enough light (or no light at all when the lens cap has not been removed)
- Camera didn't manage to focus (that's why we advise to disable the autofocus and manually set it at the beginning)
